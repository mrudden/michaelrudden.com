My personal homepage: keep it simple edition

## Notes
- **11/14/2021:** I have removed the tailwind dependency by creating equivalent classes by hand. Network tab in Firefox indicates this has reduced the size transferred from 557.45 KB to 10.56 KB. The site is now ~1/52 as large as it was.
- **11/14/2021:** Currently this site uses [tailwindcss via a CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn) which is not ideal. I may do away with tailwind all together for this page, as nothing is too complicated and that would remove a dependency. It was great to get things up and running quickly though!
