My personal homepage: keep it simple edition

## Notes
Currently this site uses [tailwindcss via a CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn) which is not ideal. I may do away with tailwind all together for this page, as nothing is too complicated and that would remove a dependency. It was great to get things up and running quickly though!
